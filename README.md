# Urban Forms Through the Lens of Human Mobility


Sensing urban form with massive mobility traces


## This work defines,

### (I) urban form metric $\Delta KS$, a metric to measure the spatial heterogeneity of mobility scale (Rg);

### (II) "shelter-at-home" indicator $KS_{HBT}$, a metric to measure the "staying-at-home" of the population in a city.
